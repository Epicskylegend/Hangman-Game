# Hangman-Game


## This is a game I worked on in Python that is reminiscent of the popular hangman game.

### At the start you will be prompted with a random generated word to solve.
### You will have to enter in letters on your keyboard to proceed.
### If you guesse the correct letter, the word on the screen will be updated.
### If you guess the wrong letter, you'll lose one of your 6 lives and the hangman will start to be drawn.
### The game ends when you solve the word, or when you run out of lives.
